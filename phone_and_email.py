Notes:

"-" is called hyphen
"|" is called pipe
"_" is called underline

"(wo)?" to match zero or just ONE instance = matches batman, batwoman, but not batwowowowoman
"(wo)*" to match ZERO or more instances = matches all of them - batman, matwoman, batwowowowoman...
"(wo)+" to match one or more instances = matches matwoman, batwowowowoman, but not batman

The {n} matches exactly n of the preceding group.
The {n,} matches n or more of the preceding group.
The {,m} matches 0 to m of the preceding group.
The {n,m} matches at least n and at most m of the preceding group.
{n,m}? or *? or +? performs a nongreedy match of the preceding group.

"?" is used also for declaring a nongreedy match
for example re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}?') => HaHaHa, without "?" => HaHaHaHaHa

search() will return a match object (mo) of the first matched text
findall() method will return the strings of every match:
a list of strings if there are no groups... ['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000']
a list of tuples if there are groups ()()()... [('415', '555', '9999'), ('212', '555', '0000')]

\d, \w, and \s match a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
\D, \W, and \S match anything except a digit, word, or space character, respectively.

[abc] matches any character between the brackets (such as a, b, or c)
[^abc] matches any character that isnâ€™t between the brackets, with "^" caret symbol, which is used as well in:

(r'^Hello') to find strings starting with "Hello"
(r'\d$') to find strings ending with a digit 0-9

"." (or dot) character in a regular expression is called a wildcard and will match any character except for a newline

nameRegex = re.compile(r'First Name: (.*) Last Name: (.*)') where ".*" means "anything" except a newline
to match all, the newline (\n) included, add "re.DOTALL"

re.compile(r'robocop', re.I) = regex case-insensitive

namesRegex = re.compile(r'Agent \w+')
namesRegex.sub('CENSORED', 'Agent Alice gave the secret documents to Agent Bob.')
"CENSORED gave the secret documents to CENSORED."
