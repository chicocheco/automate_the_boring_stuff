"""
OpenPyXL supports creating bar, line, scatter, and pie charts using the email_data in a sheetâ€™s cells. 
To make a chart, you need to do the following:

Create a Reference object from a rectangular selection of cells.
Create a Series object by passing in the Reference object.
Create a Chart object.
Append the Series object to the Chart object.
Add the Chart object to the Worksheet object, 
optionally specifying which cell the from_top from_left corner of the chart should be positioned.
