It is calling the print() function and passing its return value (print()â€™s return value is always None)
as the target keyword argument.

WARNING!!!! To avoid concurrency issues, never let multiple threads read or write the same variables.
When you create a new Thread object, make sure its target function uses ONLY LOCAL variables in that function.
This will avoid hard-to-debug concurrency issues in your programs.
